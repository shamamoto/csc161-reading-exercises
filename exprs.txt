/*Question 1:
int means the variables are listed as integers. float indicates that there may be a fractional part (decimal involved). 
16-bit ints are between -32768 and 32767. float is at least six sig figs and has a magnitude typically between 
10^-38 and 10^38. short means short integer and double means double-precision floating point. 


Question 2:

int main (void) {
float y = (2 + 5)/2;
printf (%f\n", y);
}

Answer will be 3.000 because the float tells us that it will be a floating-point decimal. Which means we call
it by %f thus printing as a floating-point (a integer that has fractional part). This truncates to 3.000 because the
numbers given are not in decimal form (ex. 2.0). 

Question 3:

int main (void) {
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
int x = i++;
int y = ++j;
}

Answers will be 2. Because ++ increments by one (for each +) and before or after the variable does not matter. */
