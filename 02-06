The compiler would read the second if as the else statement. 
This would mean that if you gave the compiler 75, it would see that it is not
greater than 90 so it would give the else statement - the letter b - which 
is not what we want this code to do. 

// In grade.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int grade = /* arbitrary initialiaztion of grade */;
    char letter = 'f';    /* by default... */

    if (grade > 90) {
        letter = 'a';
    }
    else if (grade > 80) {
        letter = 'b';
    }
    else if (grade > 70) {
        letter = 'c';
    }
    else if (grade > 60) {
        letter = 'd';
    }
    else printf("%c\n", letter);
    return 0;
}
